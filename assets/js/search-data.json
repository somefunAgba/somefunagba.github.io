Stochastic gradient learning can be considered as one of the most important algorithms in the world, behind the success of deep learning. As an early-career researcher, I am currently studying why training deep neural networks via the stochastic gradient algorithm succeeds in practice. While classic optimization theory motivates, they do not provide exact fundamental guarantees for the deep learning setting. My current research shows that a key factor is the presence of fundamental signal processing elements found in almost all practical stochastic gradient learning variants. Long‑term vision: To establish myself as a leader in AI, in the future, I see myself as an engineer in a related role, either as a research scientist or professor. I am open to new challenges and look to continue research that closes the gap on the key fundamental dynamics behind the learning algorithms that power deep learning. Through this, I hope to deepen our understanding of why certain learning algorithms succeed and collaborate to develop new approaches that are both reliable and grounded in theory for solving complex real-world problems. 📬 Let’s connect: If you’re interested in research collaboration, applied AI projects, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or Email.

Practical Approximation . In real training: . | Expectations are estimated with exponential moving averages (EMA). | For numerical stability, we use the normalized gradient form. | As a safety margin, the iteration-dependent learning rate estimate is modulated with a small \\(\\mu\\digamma(t)\\) which acts as a trust-region against the effect of noisy gradient scales, and a locally-optimal estimate. | . Let \\(0 \\le \\mu\\digamma(t) \\le 1\\), where \\(\\mu &gt; 0\\), \\(0\\le \\digamma(t) \\le 1\\) is a learning-rate schedule.

The learning rate becomes . \\[\\alpha_t = \\mu \\digamma(t)\\, \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{w}_t \\,\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t]}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{g}_t^2]}}.\\] . EMA Realizations . Track the second moment of the gradient: . \\[\\mathbf{b}_t = \\beta_b \\,\\mathbf{b}_{t-1} + \\mu (1 - \\beta_b) \\,\\mathbf{g}_t^2\\] → smooths out noisy gradient magnitudes. Define the RMS-normalizer: . \\[\\mathbf{d}_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathbf{b}_t}{1 - \\beta_b^t}} + \\epsilon\\] → bias-corrected RMS with small \\(\\epsilon\\) to prevent division by zero. Track the numerator term: . \\[\\mathbf{a}_t = \\beta_a \\,\\mathbf{a}_{t-1} + \\mu \\,\\mathbf{w}_t \\,\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t\\] → running estimate of the weight–gradient correlation. Finally: . \\[\\alpha_t = \\digamma(t)\\,\\frac{\\mathbf{a}_t}{\\mathbf{d}_t}.\\] Note: This reduces to Adam when \\(\\mathbf{a}_t\\) is replaced by a fixed constant \\(\\mu\\). Partial-correlation: Noise-robust variant . The learning-rate’s numerator is a partial-correlation estimate and is prone to heavy‑tailed stochastic weight-gradient noisy correlations, sign flips and occasional magnitude spikes. As a design prior (\\(\\alpha_t &gt; 0\\)), before dividing the numerator by the denominator, we want to ensure that the numerator remains positive, well‑bounded, and free from overshoot due to noisy, heavy-tailed gradient statistics. In other words, we want to limit rare spikes in the instantaneous partial correlation term without distorting the bulk of the signal. \\[\\mathbf{u}_t = \\mathbf{w}_t \\, \\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t\\] . 1. Huber Clipping . Heavy-tailed gradient noise statistics induce erroneous spikes that can dominate the EMA’s estimate over many iterations and increase its bias from the true mean estimate. Since, we do not know the probability distribution, Markov’s inequality gives a rationale for how often large such values can occur. The inequality . \\[\\mathbb{Pr}[|u| \\ge c\\,\\mathbb{E}[|u|] ] \\le \\frac{1}{c},\\] relates how large the magnitude of \\(u\\) can be relative to its expected magnitude. Huberisation (Menon et al., 2020) is a practical way to robustly mitigate such heavy-tailed values. The Huber clipping function bounds the most extreme outliers (\\(c \\times\\) the expected scale) before they enter the EMA, while avoiding dead zones and allowing moderate estimates to pass through untouched relative to its expected scale. \\[\\psi_{c}(u) = \\begin{cases} u, &amp; |u| \\le c\\,\\mathbb{E}[|u|] \\\\ \\mathrm{sign}(u) \\cdot c\\,\\mathbb{E}[|u|], &amp; |u| &gt; c\\,\\mathbb{E}[|u|], \\end{cases}\\] where \\(u\\) is the input, and typically \\(c=4\\) is the scale multiplier to clip only extreme outliers (\\(c\\) times) relative to the expected scale. It corresponds to the prior that the probability \\(p\\) of the magnitude being at least \\(4\\) times its mean is never more than \\(25\\%\\), and so the probability of the magnitude being less than \\(4\\) times its mean is at least \\(1-p=75\\%\\) which represent the quantiles of the distribution. This allows us to have a robust EMA estimator less sensitive to the extreme values induced by heavy-tailed noise. For the instantaneous partial correlation \\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\), we can adaptively estimate the expected scale, via the EMA estimate . \\[\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_t = \\beta_a \\, \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_a)\\,|{\\mathbf{u}}_t|,\\] where \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}_t\\) adapts to the typical scale of \\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\) in each layer. 2. Min-Clipping and Max-Normalization . Numerically, we want to ensure the estimate for the partial-correlation numerator stays within a predictable, and reasonable range, while ensuring \\(\\alpha_t \\ge 0\\). From the inequality \\(0 \\le (\\mathbf{w}_t-\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t)^2\\), we have that . \\(\\mathbf{w}_t \\,\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t \\ \\le\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\big(\\mathbf{w}_t^2 + \\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t^2\\big),\\) and so obtain the max-bound . \\[\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{w}_t \\,\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t] \\le \\,\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{w}_t^2] + \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t^2] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{w}_t^2] + 1.\\] \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{w}_t^2]\\) can be realized by maintaining an EMA estimate \\(\\mathbf{s}_t = \\beta_a \\,\\mathbf{s}_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_a) \\,\\mathbf{w}_t^2,\\) and the max-normalization scaler is \\(\\bar{\\mathbf{s}}_t = (1 + \\mathbf{s}_t)^{-1}\\). Estimation noise can flip signs of the numerator estimate or inflate or deflate the learning rate ratio, leading to unstable or zeroed steps. When the sign flips negative. The default clipping the minimum to zero stalls learning. Since learning-rate constant \\(\\mu\\) already acts as a safety margin (trust-region), a safer trust-region approach is to take the magnitude and clip the estimated learning-rate around \\(\\mu\\) using \\(\\bar{\\mathbf{s}}_t\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}_t\\). Taken together, these practical clipping techniques, helps the partial correlation estimate to remain within a predictable dynamic range (via an elementwise min. and max. operation) and helps to avoid a transient spike dominated EMA estimate (via Huber clipping), leading to . \\[\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_t = \\beta_a \\, \\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_{t-1} + \\mu\\, \\bar{\\mathbf{s}}_t\\cdot{\\psi_{c} (\\mathbf{u}_t)}\\] \\[\\mathbf{a}_t = \\max\\bigl(\\mu\\,\\bar{\\mathbf{s}}_t\\cdot\\mathbf{d}_t,\\, \\min\\bigl( |\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_t|, \\, \\mu \\bigr) \\bigr).\\] 3. Layer-wise smoothing . To account for intra-layer variability in neural networks, we replace the raw estimates with their layerwise mean, ensuring smoother parameter adaptation within each layer. Specifically, for a given layer \\(\\ell\\), with parameter size \\(n_\\ell\\), the numerator update is averaged as . \\[\\bar{a}_t = {n_\\ell}^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_\\ell} \\mathbf{a}_{t,i}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_{t,i} \\leftarrow \\bar{a}_t \\ \\ \\forall i \\in \\ell.\\] . Partial-correlation: Relaxed Upper-bound variant . Since \\(\\mathbf{u}_t = \\mathbf{w}_t \\,\\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t \\ \\le\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\big(\\mathbf{w}_t^2 + \\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t^2\\big),\\) . we may replace \\(\\mathbf{u}_t\\) with a relaxed form of the upper-bound, that is a symmetric term \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_t = \\mathbf{w}_t^2 + \\bar{\\mathbf{g}}_t^2\\), weighted by \\(\\mu &lt; \\frac{1}{2}\\). Then a simpler estimate than the previous variant becomes . \\[\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_t = \\beta_a \\,\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_{t-1} + (1 - \\beta_a) \\,\\mu\\,\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}_t.\\] \\[\\mathbf{a}_t = \\min\\bigl( |\\tilde{\\mathbf{a}}_t|, \\, \\mu \\bigr).\\] Layer wise smoothing can be applied next.

If you’ve trained a large neural network in the last few years, you’ve probably used or heard of cosine annealing. It’s a go-to learning rate schedule, celebrated for its ability to coax better performance out of deep learning models. Learning rate schedules are the unsung heroes of deep learning optimization. In the ever-evolving landscape of deep learning, learning rate schedules play a pivotal role in training stability and generalization. The idea is simple: You start with a higher learning rate and gradually decrease it following a cosine curve, ending near zero. It’s a standard trick of the trade that consistently delivers smoother convergence and better results. But a fundamental question has lingered: Why is it so effective? Is there something magical about the cosine function itself? . In this paper, Annealing via Window Functions, we emerge with a powerful insight: The magic isn’t in the cosine at all. It’s in its behavior. This insight not only provides an explanation for the success of commonly-used annealing functions but also opens the door to simpler, more efficient alternatives. ",

    "title": "Overview",
    "content": "The present paper contributes to the field of deep learning optimization by reframing the design of learning-rate annealing schedules from an empirical art into a principled, analytical science rooted in classical signal processing. Its central thesis posits that the empirical success of popular schedules, such as cosine annealing, is not attributable to their specific functional form but rather to their underlying first-order dynamic properties. The research makes three primary contributions. First, it introduces a unified theoretical framework that interprets a broad family of learning-rate schedules as signal-shaping window functions. The behavior of these functions is characterized by a novel, dimensionless metric: the time-normalized relative rate of change, denoted as \\(\\bar{\\gamma}(t)\\). This metric provides a universal basis for comparing the dynamic behavior of disparate schedules. Second, the paper derives and proposes a set of three-stage, piecewise constraints on the profile of \\(\\bar{\\gamma}(t)\\). These constraints are designed to enforce a controlled and balanced transition from high-exploration dynamics in the early stages of training to high-exploitation dynamics in the late stages, providing a principled foundation for schedule design. Third, the framework is used to synthesize a variety of novel, computationally efficient, and tunable learning-rate schedules. The authors demonstrate that by matching the first-order dynamics prescribed by the framework, these alternative schedules can achieve performance on par with, and sometimes superior to, established baselines. The paper’s theoretical claims are substantiated through extensive empirical validation. Across a diverse set of experiments involving GPT-2 and ResNet-18 models on language modeling and image classification tasks, the results consistently demonstrate that the performance of an annealing schedule is dictated by its adherence to the proposed first-order dynamic constraints. Schedules that satisfy the three-stage conditions on \\(\\bar{\\gamma}(t)\\) are shown to be effectively interchangeable, converging to statistically identical performance plateaus. Conversely, schedules deliberately designed to violate these conditions exhibit predictably poorer performance, characterized by slower convergence and higher final loss or error rates. This robust validation establishes the framework not only as a powerful explanatory tool but also as a practical guide for the design and selection of effective learning-rate schedules. ",

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Learning Rate Annealing",
    "content": "The paper’s central innovation is the development of a cohesive theoretical framework that demystifies the behavior of learning-rate annealing schedules. By moving beyond empirical observation, it establishes a set of first principles that govern schedule effectiveness, grounded in analogies to signal processing and simulated annealing. From Heuristics to Principles: Annealing as Signal Processing . The research begins by addressing a fundamental, yet largely unanswered, question in deep learning optimization: why does cosine annealing work so effectively? Despite its widespread adoption and consistent empirical success, the mechanisms underlying its performance have remained poorly understood. The paper’s foundational step is to re-contextualize this problem by drawing a powerful analogy to the well-established field of signal processing. It proposes that learning-rate schedules should not be viewed as arbitrary mathematical functions but as classical signal-shaping “window functions,” a concept with a rich theoretical background. This reframing is a critical intellectual leap. By identifying cosine annealing as mathematically equivalent to a half-period, second-order raised-cosine (or Hann) window, the authors unlock a new analytical vocabulary. Concepts such as tapering, spectral properties, and time-domain dynamics, which are standard in signal processing, can now be applied to understand the behavior of learning rates during training. This cross-disciplinary approach provides a new, more powerful lens through which to view all schedules. It shifts the focus from the static “shape” of the function to its dynamic properties over the training interval, ultimately leading to the discovery that the schedule’s rate of change, not its specific formula, is the key determinant of its success. The Simulated Annealing Analogy: Deriving First-Order Dynamics . To build a formal model, the framework draws upon the principles of simulated annealing, a classic optimization concept. In physical annealing, the rate at which temperature is lowered (the “cooling schedule”) is paramount to achieving a low-energy, highly-ordered final state; cooling too quickly or too slowly results in a defective structure. The paper posits that the learning rate schedule, \\(\\digamma(t)\\), plays an analogous role to this cooling function in stochastic gradient descent. This analogy is formalized by introducing a \\(\\delta\\)-dependent acceptance function, \\(\\Phi(t) = e^{-\\delta\\theta(t)}\\), where \\(\\theta(t) = \\digamma(t)^{-1}\\) and \\(\\delta\\) represents the maximum absolute change in the learning cost function per iteration, which is shown to be bounded under standard assumptions (given in the paper’s Appendix A). This function mathematically captures the intuitive goal of the training process: to transition smoothly from a state of high exploration (high acceptance of large parameter updates, facilitated by a large \\(\\digamma(t)\\)) to a state of high exploitation (low acceptance, allowing for convergence to a local minimum with small updates from a small \\(\\digamma(t)\\)). This step is pivotal as it forges a direct mathematical link between the abstract exploration-exploitation trade-off and the concrete, measurable properties of the learning rate schedule \\(\\digamma(t)\\). The Time-Normalized Relative Rate \\(\\bar{\\gamma}(t)\\): A Universal Metric for Schedule Behavior . The framework’s core analytical tool is derived by imposing a simple, physically motivated constraint on the acceptance function: it should not decay faster than intended between successive iterations. This is expressed as \\(\\Phi(t+1) \\ge \\beta(t)\\Phi(t)\\), which prevents a greedy, premature collapse into a suboptimal minimum. From this inequality, the authors derive the key variable of the paper: the time-normalized relative rate of change, defined for \\(t&gt;0\\) as: . \\[\\overline{\\gamma}(t) = \\frac{1 - \\digamma(t)}{t\\digamma(t)}\\] This quantity, \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\), is presented as a dimensionless metric, a crucial property that allows it to serve as a universal comparator of schedule dynamics. By normalizing the instantaneous rate of change by both the current schedule value \\(\\digamma(t)\\) and the elapsed time \\(t\\), \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) captures the intrinsic dynamic behavior of any schedule, independent of its specific functional form or total duration. This metric can be interpreted as a measure of “optimization pressure.” The numerator, \\(1 - \\digamma(t)\\), represents the total decay the schedule has undergone from its starting value of \\(1\\). The denominator, \\(t\\digamma(t)\\), can be seen as a time-weighted measure of the current learning capacity. The ratio, \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\), therefore quantifies the aggressiveness of the decay relative to the current state of the schedule. A low \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) signifies that the decay has been gradual, maintaining a high degree of “exploration pressure.” Conversely, a high \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) indicates that the decay has been rapid, signaling a decisive shift toward “exploitation pressure.” This physical intuition explains why controlling the profile of \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) over time is fundamental to managing the training process effectively. The Three-Stage Constraint: A Principled Approach to Exploration and Exploitation . Based on the concept of controlled optimization pressure, the paper proposes a set of prescriptive, piecewise constraints on the profile of \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) over the training interval \\(\\tau\\). These constraints define what the authors term favorable first-order dynamics. | Early-to-mid stage (\\(0 \\le t \\le \\tau/2\\)): The framework requires \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) to be uniformly small, specifically bounded such that \\(\\digamma(t) \\ge 1/2\\) (for a conservative choice of a slack variable). This constraint acts as a safeguard against premature decay, forcing the optimizer to maintain a high learning rate and engage in sustained exploration during the critical first half of training. | Late stage (\\(t \\ge \\tau-1\\)): To ensure effective convergence, the constraint \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t) \\ge 1\\) is imposed, which corresponds to a learning rate \\(\\digamma(t) \\le 1/\\tau\\). This pushes the optimizer into a high-exploitation regime, enabling fine-grained search around a potential minimum. | Mid-to-late stage (\\(\\tau/2 \\le t &lt; \\tau\\)): A smooth transition between the early and late stage regimes is enforced to prevent sharp, potentially destabilizing changes in the learning rate dynamics. | . Together, these three stages define a controlled, monotonic profile for \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\): it should start low and relatively flat, then rise smoothly and accelerate towards the end of training. These conditions are not arbitrary bounds; they represent a principled recipe for applying the right amount of optimization pressure at the right time. The paper provides a compelling visual proof in Figure 1, which shows that the \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profiles of both standard cosine and linear decay schedules naturally adhere to this three-stage template, offering a novel and powerful explanation for their long-observed empirical success.

    "title": "Analysis of Canonical and Alternative Window Functions",
    "content": "The theoretical framework provides a powerful lens for both analyzing existing schedules and generating novel, effective alternatives. This section examines how the principles of first-order dynamics apply to canonical schedules and explores the design space of new functions synthesized using the framework. Deconstructing Baseline Schedules: Raised-Cosine and Linear Decay . The paper first applies its framework to the two most common learning rate schedules: raised-cosine (cosine annealing) and linear decay. The raised-cosine schedule is defined as: . \\[\\digamma(t) = \\mathcal{R}(t)[l + (1-l)\\cos^2(0.5\\pi x(t))],\\] where \\(x(t) = t/\\tau\\) and \\(l\\) is the minimum output value, typically \\(0\\). The linear decay function is simply . \\[\\digamma(t) = \\mathcal{R}(t)(1-x(t)).\\] While these functions have very different mathematical forms: one is trigonometric, and the other is a polynomial; the analysis of their corresponding \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profiles reveals a striking similarity. As visualized in Figure 1 of the paper, both schedules produce a \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) curve that remains low and nearly constant for the first half of the training interval before rising smoothly in the second half. This demonstrates that both functions, despite their differences, inherently satisfy the three-stage constraint for favorable first-order dynamics. This finding serves as the first key piece of evidence for the paper’s central thesis: the shared dynamic behavior, not the specific function, is the source of their effectiveness. A Design Space of Alternatives: Parametric Exponential, Polynomial, and Sigmoid Functions . Having established that the framework can explain existing schedules, the paper then demonstrates its generative power by introducing three new families of tunable, computationally efficient window functions : . | \\(\\beta\\)-parametric exponential function: Defined as \\(\\digamma(t) = \\mathcal{R}(t)(\\beta^{x(t)} - \\beta) / (1 - \\beta)\\), this function smoothly interpolates between linear decay (as \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 1\\)) and a sharp exponential decay (as \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 0\\)). | Simple polynomial functions: A general form \\(\\digamma(t) = \\mathcal{R}(t)(1 - x(t)^i)^n\\) is proposed as a computationally cheaper alternative to the raised-cosine. For instance, with \\(n=2\\) and \\(i \\approx 1.8\\), it closely mimics the shape of the cosine schedule. | Logistic sigmoid function: A shifted and scaled logistic function, \\(\\digamma(t) = \\mathcal{R}(t)\\delta_h^{-1}[(1 + b^{2i(x(t)-0.5)})^{-1} - \\underline{h}]\\), offers another way to approximate the desired decay profile, with a parameter \\(i\\) controlling the steepness of the transition. | . These functions are not presented as inherently superior to the baselines but as proof of concept. They illustrate that one can start with the target dynamic profile: the three-stage constraints on \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\); and then engineer multiple, distinct, and practical functions that successfully implement it. The Impact of Shaping Parameters on First-Order Dynamics and Acceptance Collapse . A crucial part of the analysis involves examining how the shaping parameters of these new function families (i.e., \\(\\beta\\) for the exponential, \\(i\\) for the polynomial, and \\(i\\) for the sigmoid) influence the \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profile and, consequently, training stability. The paper introduces the concept of acceptance collapse a phenomenon where an improperly configured schedule causes the acceptance function \\(\\Phi(t)\\)to plummet to zero prematurely, effectively halting meaningful exploration and trapping the optimizer. The analysis, supported by Figures 2, 3, and 4, demonstrates a clear causal chain: . | A poor choice of a shaping parameter (e.g., a very small \\(\\beta\\), a tiny or very large \\(i\\)) leads to a \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profile that severely violates the three-stage constraints. | This malformed \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profile results in a premature or abrupt acceptance collapse. | This collapse in acceptance leads to poor training outcomes, as later validated by the experiments. | . This analysis reveals that the framework does more than just describe schedules. It provides a safe operating area for their design. The design recommendations in Appendix B explicitly define the ranges of the shaping parameters that ensure the schedule’s dynamics remain compliant (e.g., \\(\\beta \\approx 1\\), moderate \\(i\\) for polynomials between \\(1\\) and \\(10\\), small-to-moderate \\(i &lt; 6\\) for logistics). This transforms the task of schedule tuning from a black-box hyperparameter search into a more principled process of selecting parameters that keep the schedule’s dynamics within the prescribed safe bounds. The following table summarizes these characteristics. | Window Function Family | Mathematical Form \\(\\digamma(t)\\) | Shaping Parameter(s) | Characteristic \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) Behavior | Recommended Safe Parameter Range | . | \\(\\beta\\)-Parametric Exponential | \\(\\mathcal{R}(t)\\frac{\\beta^{x(t)} - \\beta}{1 - \\beta}\\) | \\(\\beta \\in (0, 1)\\) | As \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 0\\), \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) spikes early, violating the early-stage constraint. As \\(\\beta \\rightarrow 1\\), it approaches linear decay. | \\(\\beta \\approx 1\\) | . | Simple Polynomial | \\(\\mathcal{R}(t)\\left(1 - x(t)^i\\right)^n\\) | \\(i &gt; 0, \\; n &gt; 0\\) | As \\(i \\rightarrow 0\\), decay is too rapid (early collapse). As \\(i \\rightarrow \\infty\\), decay is too delayed (late collapse). | \\(1 &lt; i &lt; 10\\) (for \\(n = 2\\)) | . | Logistic Sigmoid | Scaled &amp; Shifted Sigmoid | \\(i &gt; 0\\) (slope) | As \\(i\\) becomes large, the transition sharpens, violating the mid–late stage smoothness constraint. | \\(i &lt; 6\\) (prevent sharp transitions around mid-inflection) | . Decoupling from Training Duration: The Role of the Kronecker Input Sequence . In a subtle but significant contribution, the paper addresses a practical limitation of most schedules: their definition relies on a pre-defined total number of training iterations, \\(\\tau\\), through the input variable \\(x(t) = t/\\tau\\). To overcome this, the authors propose replacing this uniformly spaced sequence with a quasi-random Kronecker sequence: . \\[x(t) = \\phi t \\pmod 1, \\quad \\text{where } \\phi = 0.5(-1 + \\sqrt{5})\\] This sequence, related to the golden ratio, has the property of populating the unit interval \\([0, 1)\\) uniformly with low discrepancy, but without any reference to a total length \\(\\tau\\). This allows for the construction of a learning rate schedule that is fundamentally decoupled from the training budget. While the resulting schedule is non-monotonic, a sorted version can be precomputed and used as a lookup table. This innovation offers greater flexibility for training scenarios where the total number of iterations is unknown or variable. ",

    "title": "Empirical Validation Across Diverse Architectures and Datasets",
    "content": "The paper’s theoretical framework is subjected to rigorous empirical testing to validate its core claims: the interchangeability of schedules with favorable dynamics and the performance degradation caused by violating those dynamics. Experimental Design and Methodology . The experimental design is comprehensive, aiming to establish the generalizability of the findings across different tasks, model architectures, and scales. | Models and Datasets: The tests include a 30M and 124M parameter GPT-2 model for language modeling on the character-level Shakespeare and WikiText datasets, and a ResNet-18 model for image classification on CIFAR-10. | Schedules Under Test: The experiments compare two standard baselines (\\(\\digamma_C(t)\\): raised-cosine; \\(\\digamma_L(t)\\): linear decay) against a suite of the proposed alternatives. This suite is strategically divided into “compliant” schedules that satisfy the three-stage conditions (e.g., \\(\\digamma_{P2}(t)\\), \\(\\digamma_{S4}(t)\\), \\(\\digamma_{E0.99}(t)\\)) and violating schedules designed as negative controls (\\(\\digamma_{E0.05}(t)\\), which violates the early-stage condition, and \\(\\digamma_{S40}(t)\\), which violates the mid-late stage condition). | Training Configuration: All experiments were conducted on a single GPU, with results averaged over up to 10 independent runs to ensure statistical robustness. Standard optimization practices like momentum were used consistently across all runs. This diverse and well-controlled setup provides a strong foundation for evaluating the practical impact of the proposed framework. | . Performance Analysis: When First-Order Dynamics Align . The central experimental result of the paper is the remarkable consistency in performance among all schedules that exhibit favorable first-order dynamics. | Quantitative Results: The data presented in Tables 1 and 2 show that across all model-dataset combinations, the final test loss (for GPT-2) or test error rate (for ResNet-18) achieved by the compliant alternative schedules is statistically indistinguishable from, or in some cases slightly better than, the performance of the standard cosine and linear baselines. For example, on CIFAR-10, the linear decay baseline (\\(\\digamma_L(t)\\)) achieved a test error of \\(0.0403 \\pm 0.0001\\), while the compliant alternatives \\(\\digamma_{S4}(t)\\) and \\(\\digamma_{E0.99}(t)\\) achieved nearly identical errors of \\(0.0405 \\pm 0.0007\\) and \\(0.0402 \\pm 0.0007\\), respectively. | Qualitative Results: Figures 5 and 6 provide a powerful visual confirmation of this finding. The convergence curves for all compliant schedules (both baselines and alternatives) are tightly clustered, especially in the critical late stages of training. They follow nearly identical trajectories and converge to the same performance plateau. | . This body of evidence strongly supports the paper’s core thesis of interchangeability. It demonstrates that the specific mathematical identity of a schedule is secondary; what truly governs performance is its adherence to the underlying principles of controlled first-order dynamics captured by the \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profile. The Cost of Violation: Quantifying Performance Degradation . The experiments including the violating schedules, \\(\\digamma_{E0.05}(t)\\) and $$\\digamma_{S40}(t), serve as a critical control group. By demonstrating that a deliberate violation of the framework’s principles leads to a predictable and consistent degradation in performance, the authors establish a strong causal link between favorable dynamics and successful training. The results are unambiguous. In every experiment, these two schedules performed significantly worse than their compliant counterparts. | On the Shakespeare dataset, the baseline cosine schedule achieved a test loss of \\(0.164\\), while the violating schedules \\(\\digamma_{E0.05}(t)\\) and \\(\\digamma_{S40}(t)\\) plateaued at much higher losses of \\(0.178\\) and \\(0.262\\), respectively. | Similarly, on CIFAR-10, the baseline test error was around \\(4.0-4.1\\%\\), whereas the violating schedules yielded higher error rates of \\(4.3\\%\\) (\\(\\digamma_{E0.05}(t)\\)) and \\(4.17\\%\\) (\\(\\digamma_{S40}(t)\\)). | The convergence plots in Figures 5 and 6 visually depict this gap, showing the curves for the violating schedules leveling off at a visibly higher loss/error than the tightly clustered group of compliant schedules. | . This consistent underperformance of schedules with malformed \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profiles provides compelling evidence that the three-stage constraints are not merely correlational but are indeed predictive of a schedule’s effectiveness. | Experiment | Baseline Performance (Mean ± SE) | Compliant Alternatives’ Performance Range | Violating \\(F_{E0.05}(t)\\) Performance | Violating \\(F_{S40}(t)\\) Performance | . | GPT‑2 30M Shakespeare (Test Loss) | 0.159 – 0.164 | 0.159 – 0.162 | 0.178 ± 0.002 | 0.262 ± 0.004 | . | GPT‑2 124M WikiText (Test Loss) | 2.744 – 2.901 | 2.746 – 2.903 | 2.763 ± 0.011 | 3.022 ± 0.003 | . | ResNet‑18 CIFAR‑10 (Test Error) | 0.0403 – 0.0410 | 0.0395 – 0.0409 | 0.0430 ± 0.0010 | 0.0417 ± 0.0009 | . | GPT‑2 124M Shakespeare Full‑Period (Test Loss) | 0.1017 – 0.1028 | 0.1021 – 0.1029 | N/A | N/A | . Generalizability and Flexibility . The appendices extend the experimental validation to demonstrate the framework’s robustness and flexibility. Experiments are conducted with a larger 124M parameter GPT-2 model and with different schedule configurations, including full-period (warmup + cooldown) and variable coverage (a constant-rate phase followed by decay) schedules. The results, detailed in Appendix E and summarized in Figures 10-13, show that the core findings remain consistent. Compliant schedules continue to perform interchangeably and outperform violating ones, even at a larger model scale and with more complex configurations. Notably, the full-period schedules are shown to achieve final performance comparable to their half-period (cooldown-only) counterparts, albeit with higher initial loss due to the warmup phase. This demonstrates a key aspect of the framework’s utility: it unifies not just different decay shapes but also different training paradigms. Concepts like “warmup” and “constant-plus-cooldown” can be understood as applications of the same underlying windowing principle, simply applied over different sub-intervals of the training process. This is shown theoretically in Appendix D, where simple transformations on the input sequence \\(x(t)\\) are used to generate these more complex schedule shapes from a base window. The following table synthesizes the final performance across key experiments, starkly illustrating the consistent performance gap between compliant and violating schedules. ",

    "title": "Theoretical Underpinnings and Broader Implications",
    "content": "The paper concludes by connecting its empirical framework to deeper principles in classical optimization theory and outlining the practical implications for the machine learning community. Beyond Heuristics: The Connection to Chebyshev Acceleration . Perhaps the most profound theoretical result is presented in Appendix C, which establishes a formal link between the raised-cosine schedule and the theory of accelerated optimization methods. The derivation shows that for the simplified case of optimizing a convex-quadratic function, the learning rate schedule that minimizes the worst-case error bound is derived from Chebyshev polynomials. The resulting optimal learning rate has a functional form that explicitly incorporates the raised-cosine window function. This result is significant because it elevates the cosine schedule from a well-performing heuristic to a function with deep theoretical roots in approximation theory and optimal control. It provides a principled, mathematical justification for why this particular shape is so effective, at least in this idealized setting. This finding serves as a powerful bridge between the theory of convex optimization and the practice of non-convex deep learning. While deep learning problems are non-convex, the fact that a schedule provably optimal in the convex world is also empirically superior in the non-convex world suggests that its underlying dynamics are fundamentally sound. The paper’s framework, by focusing on the first-order dynamics (\\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\)) of this optimal schedule, successfully isolates its “active ingredient,” allowing this effective dynamic to be replicated in other, more computationally convenient functions. Practical Implications for Schedule Design and Selection . The overarching conclusion of the research is that window functions with favorable first-order dynamics can be used interchangeably, providing practitioners with newfound flexibility and a principled basis for design. This translates the paper’s theoretical and empirical findings into actionable advice. | Flexibility: Practitioners are no longer bound to a single best schedule like cosine annealing or linear decay. They can now confidently choose from a family of dynamically equivalent schedules, selecting one based on other practical criteria such as computational simplicity (e.g., polynomials) or ease of tuning. | Principled Design: The framework provides the tools to design and validate novel schedules. Instead of relying on trial and error, a designer can now engineer a function and verify its potential effectiveness by simply plotting its \\(\\overline{\\gamma}(t)\\) profile and checking for compliance with the three-stage constraints. | Informed Tuning: The analysis of shaping parameters and the concept of a safe operating area provide concrete guidance for hyperparameter tuning, making the process more systematic and less of a black art. | . Concluding Remarks . In conclusion, the paper makes a substantial contribution by developing a unified, principled framework that successfully explains, generalizes, and generates effective learning-rate schedules. Its primary strength lies in its novel synthesis of ideas from signal processing, simulated annealing, and classical optimization theory to create a powerful new lens for analyzing a critical component of deep learning training. The theoretical claims are backed by strong, consistent, and generalizable empirical evidence across multiple domains. The research effectively transforms the design of learning rate schedules from an art into a science. By identifying the controlled, time-normalized relative rate of change as the key determinant of a schedule’s success, it provides both deep theoretical insight and clear, practical guidance. As suggested by the authors, future work could extend this framework to explore adaptive mechanisms for the cost-change bound \\(\\delta\\) or investigate the role of higher-order dynamic constraints. Nevertheless, this work stands as a significant step forward in building a more rigorous and fundamental understanding of the optimization dynamics that underpin modern machine learning. ",
